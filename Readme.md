# Binance Smart Chain Demo Token Template

- Total supply is 1000000
- Symbol Nerd Moon Token "NMT"
- Decimals index is 18

## How to use

```bash
uint public totalSupply = "Enter your total supply Here" * 10 ** 18;
```


```bash
string public name = "Token Name Here";
```

```bash
string public symbol = "Token Symbol Here";
```

## Important

Once token is deployed on network you won't be able to change the total supply. Other than that soon I will be uploading cryptocurrent token website here. Till than stay tuned.
